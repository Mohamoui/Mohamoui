 Hi, I’m Iman Mohamoud @Mohamoui.
 My major is Computer Sienece.
 And Iam a student at Ohio Dominican University.
 I’m interested in coding becasue
 I'm a creative and curious individual,
 and that's why coding has captured my interest.
 It's like solving puzzles and building something amazing from scratch.
 I love how coding allows you to bring ideas to life and create things that 
 can make a positive impact.
